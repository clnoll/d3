Simple scatterplot showing wind chills in Chicago, using Yahoo's weather API.  App is set to query the API every "hour" (actually every 3 seconds for the demo purposes).

User can update the scatterplot to show new data by clicking the "update" button.  Over a period of time you can see how the wind chill varies at different times of day; the color and size of the points corresponds with the temperature.
